# Ghostty

Configuration and shell setup for the [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) terminal.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask ghostty
```

## Configuration

Ghostty reads `~/.config/ghostty/config.ghostty`. It still reads a file named `config` in that directory. On macOS it also reads `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/`, and that location wins when both exist.

From this directory:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/ghostty
cp config ~/.config/ghostty/config.ghostty
```

Quit Ghostty and open it again. The copied file sets the Dracula theme, JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, window padding, and the SSH shell-integration features `ssh-terminfo` and `ssh-env`. Install the font in the next section so that family name resolves.

## Font

Install **JetBrains Mono Nerd Font**

```sh
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
```

## Auto-suggestions

**ZSH Auto-suggestions**. This plugin remembers your history and suggests commands as you type. [Documentation](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

```sh
brew install zsh-autosuggestions
```

Add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
# ZSH Auto-suggestions. This plugin remembers your history and suggests commands as you type
source "$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh"
```

Restart your terminal or run `exec zsh`

## Shell prompt

**Starship**. A minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell. [Documentation](https://starship.rs)

```sh
brew install starship
```

Add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
# Starship. Terminal Shell Prompt
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

Restart your terminal or run `exec zsh`

### Preset

Configure **Tokyo Night** preset

```sh
starship preset tokyo-night -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```
