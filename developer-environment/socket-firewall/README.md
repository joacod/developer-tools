# Socket Firewall

Install [Socket Firewall](https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free) and use it to protect dependency installs.

## What this setup does

This guide installs `sfw`, clears local package manager caches, and runs dependency installs through Socket Firewall.

- **`sfw` wraps package manager commands:** prefix the install command with `sfw`
- **Official package managers:** `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pip`, `uv`, and `cargo`
- **Bun is outside that list:** it may run, and Socket Firewall Free does not list it as supported

**Result:** you get a simple dependency install flow with an extra security layer.

## Install Socket Firewall

Install `sfw` globally.

```sh
npm i -g sfw
```

## Verify Socket Firewall

Check that sfw is available.

```sh
sfw --help
```

If that command prints the help output, Socket Firewall is installed correctly.

## Clear package manager cache

Socket Firewall works by blocking package artifact network requests.

If dependencies are already cached locally, there may be no network request to block, so clear the cache before using it.

For npm:

```sh
npm cache clean --force
```

For pnpm:

```sh
pnpm store prune
```

## Use with npm

Run installs through sfw.

```sh
sfw npm install
```

For clean installs:

```sh
sfw npm ci
```

## Use with pnpm

Run installs through sfw.

```sh
sfw pnpm install
```

For CI or lockfile-based installs:

```sh
sfw pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Use with pip, uv, or cargo

Prefix those package managers the same way:

```sh
sfw pip install requests
sfw uv pip install flask
sfw cargo fetch
```

## Add npm scripts

For a JavaScript or TypeScript project, add scripts to package.json.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "safe:install": "sfw pnpm install",
    "safe:ci": "sfw pnpm install --frozen-lockfile"
  }
}
```

Run:

```sh
npm run safe:install
```

## Add shell aliases

Add aliases so common package manager commands are always routed through `sfw` in your interactive shell.

```sh
# Socket Firewall
alias npm="sfw --verbose npm"
alias npx="sfw --verbose npx"
alias pnpm="sfw --verbose pnpm"
alias pnpx="sfw --verbose pnpx"
alias yarn="sfw --verbose yarn"
alias bun="sfw --verbose bun"
```

Put them in your shell config, such as `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, then reload your shell.

Aliases only apply to interactive shells. In CI, package scripts, and automation, call `sfw` explicitly.
