# Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a secure, identity-based networking tool built on WireGuard that makes it easy to connect devices, servers, and private services across networks.

## What it does

- Connects your devices into a private network
- Makes remote access to servers and services simpler
- Helps avoid exposing internal services directly to the public internet

## First setup

- Create a Tailscale account
- Log in with your identity provider
- Follow the setup flow to add the devices you want to connect
- Repeat the process on each machine you want in the same tailnet

## Personal plan

For personal use, the free Personal plan is usually more than enough.

- Free forever
- Up to 6 users
- Unlimited user devices
- Access to nearly all core features

## Good for

- Accessing a VPS or homelab remotely
- Reaching private services from your laptop
- Connecting machines across different networks with less VPN setup overhead

## Linux VPS commands

On the VPS, run:

```sh
sudo tailscale up
```

Check the current connection status:

```sh
tailscale status
```

Check that you can reach another machine on your tailnet:

```sh
tailscale ping your-other-machine
```

If you want to use the regular system ping instead, use the machine name or Tailscale IP:

```sh
ping -c 4 your-other-machine
```

## VPS access controls

For VPS installations, the recommended next step after enrollment is [VPS access controls](./vps-access-controls.md). It tags the VPS, disables its key expiry, and restricts the tailnet so your devices can reach the server while the server cannot initiate connections back to your devices.

Apply and verify it before removing public SSH access.

## Serve a local URL

To expose a local service only inside your tailnet, run this on the machine hosting the service:

```sh
sudo tailscale serve --bg --https=9119 localhost:9119
```

This runs in the background, and Tailscale Serve stays configured even after a reboot.

Check the current Serve status:

```sh
tailscale serve status
```

You should see something similar to:

```text
Serve is enabled
Proxy: http://127.0.0.1:9119
Available within your tailnet at:
https://your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net:9119
```

From your Mac, open the URL in a browser:

```sh
open https://your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net:9119
```

To disable all Serve configuration on that machine, reset it:

```sh
tailscale serve reset
```

If you want to disable only that one Serve mapping, use:

```sh
tailscale serve --https=9119 off
```

If you are using multiple Serve mappings or non-default flags, use the matching `off` form for the specific mapping you want to remove.

## Notes

- Use the machine name or Tailscale IP when testing connectivity
- If MagicDNS is enabled, machine names are usually the easiest option
- `tailscale serve` shares the service only inside your tailnet, not publicly on the internet
- `tailscale serve reset` clears all Serve configuration on that machine, while matching `tailscale serve ... off` commands are better when you want to remove only one specific mapping

## VPS guides

For a VPS that already uses the base hardening guide, start with [VPS access controls](./vps-access-controls.md), then use [SSH over Tailscale for VPS](./ssh-over-tailscale-for-vps.md) to keep normal OpenSSH users and keys while removing public SSH exposure.
